# 1Password CLI Java Wrapper ![CI](https://github.com/mpdeimos/onepassword-java/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Developing

* Import the repository as Gradle project in your IDE (VSCode, IntelliJ, Eclipse).
* If tests complain about that `build/bin/op` cannot be found, execute `./gradlew bootstrap` first. This will download the 1password CLI (at the moment only implemented for Linux and Windows).
